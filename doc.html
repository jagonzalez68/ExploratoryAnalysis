<h2>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS DOCUMENTATION.</h2>
<p>
<p>This Shiny App was created to perform basic Exploratory Data Analysis to a few data sets. The datasets included are:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Breast Cancer </li>
    <li> Soybean </li>
    <li> DNA </li>
    <li> Vehicle </li>
    <li> Prostate.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<p>You can select the dataset in the left panel, in the very first selection box.</p>

<p>For each dataset, different exploratory information will be displayed by clicking in the corresponding tabs at the right:</p>
<ol>
    <li> Summary, Summary of the Dataset (no input required)</li>
    <li> Features, Names of the Features (no input required)</li>
    <li> Number of Samples, Number of Samples in the Dataset (no input required)</li>
    <li> Attribute Table, an Attribute's table for the selected attribute (INPUT REQUIRED)</li>
    <li> Histogram, Histogram of the selected attribute (INPUT REQUIRED)</li>
    <li> Scatter Plot, Scatterplot with the two selected attributes (INPUT REQUIRED)</li>
</ol>
<p>No parameters are required for the options Summary, Features, and Number of Samples, you only need to select the tab with the name of the option.</p>
<p>For the case of the Histogram option, you need to specify one attribute (by its number, i.e. 11) in the corresponding text box at the left and identified with the histogram caption. This option is meant to work with nominal attributes</p>
<p>In the case of the Scatter Plot option, you need to input two parameters, which correspond to the numbers of the attributes to use in the plot. These numbers are also specified in the left panel in the text boxes with the corresponding caption: Attribute one and Attribute two. This option works very nice with numerica attributes</p>
